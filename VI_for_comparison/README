This code is used to make a simple comparison between your VI results with the results in a truth table.
1. To use it, you need python 3, panda.
2. Modify the directory, file name, and, the corresponding truth table file name in line 75 and 76
3. Run the code and it will output a file with filename_comparison_results.txt which will tell you the disagreement between the two files.
4. Try to understand the differences. 
5. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the slack channel #visual_inspection and contact the VI leads.
